# Tutorial on deep learning for NLP: Word vectors and neural networks in Python

Samuel RÃ¶nnqvist

In deep learning, a key principle is to learn abstract representations
of data, rather than relying on manual feature engineering, as suitable
input for modeling tasks. For natural language processing, this approach
may provide means of obtaining representations from data that are more
complete, generalizing and flexible to construct. This tutorial focuses
on word vectors (semantic space embeddings) as a representation of
word-level semantics, for use in classification tasks. We will use some
helpful Python libraries to train word vectors from unlabeled text, and
use them as features for classification, using neural networks in both
steps.
